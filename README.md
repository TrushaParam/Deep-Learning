In this project, I developed a predictive model using the Perceptron algorithm to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic. The original dataset was sourced from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database on Kaggle, which contains various medical predictor variables and a binary target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.
The Perceptron model successfully classified individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic with a commendable accuracy. The project demonstrated the efficacy of the Perceptron algorithm for binary classification tasks in the medical domain. Additionally, the pre-processing steps and the use of standardized features were pivotal in achieving accurate predictions.
